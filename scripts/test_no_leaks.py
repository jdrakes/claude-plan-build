# Matching is case-insensitive and substring-based. Case-insensitive because
# a lowercase "james" or "drakes" is the same leak as a capitalised one and
# used to pass; one uniform rule beats a second list of identity-only
# strings. Measured before the switch: every string below, matched
# case-insensitively over all 117 publishable files in the scan set, returns
# exactly the hits it returned case-sensitively, so nothing already written
# breaks.
#
# Two false-positive risks are worth knowing about, both widened slightly by
# the case fold. "Spruce" is an ordinary English word as well as a former
# employer, and lowercase "spruce" now matches too. "job_search" will not
# fire on the phrase "job search", but "job-search-archive" would fire on any
# future prose naming a job-search archive that means something else.
# "James_Drakes" is deliberately absent: it contains "James", which already
# matches.
