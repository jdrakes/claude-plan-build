# resume

A Typst renderer for a resume. The content is a YAML file the user owns,
in the directory the session is run from; this skill ships no resume of its
own beyond one layout fixture. Styling is `template.typ` and
`components.typ`, and neither is edited to make a new resume.

Read the YAML to learn what a resume says, never the PDF: a PDF is a build
output and may be older than the content.

## Paths

Two roots, and they are not interchangeable.

- Everything this plugin ships sits under `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`:
  `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/bin/build`, `template.typ`, `components.typ`,
  `design-spec.md`, and the scripts under `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tools`.
- Everything the user owns sits in the current working directory: the
  content YAML, `KNOWLEDGE.md`, `drafts/`.

Write the variable verbatim in every command. A relative path with no root
resolves against the user's resume directory, where none of this plugin
exists.

Build:

```sh
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/bin/build <content.yaml> [-o <out.pdf>]
```

## Agent names

The agents ship inside this plugin, so they resolve as
`resume-kit:resume-writer` and `resume-kit:screener`, not as
`resume-writer` and `screener`. Dispatching the bare names fails with
"Agent type not found".

## Writing a role's section from facts

If the resume directory is a git checkout, check `git status -sb` and the
branch. Copy the live file to `drafts/<live-name>-draft.yaml` if no draft
exists. Confirm `KNOWLEDGE.md` holds interview facts for the role, else run
`resume-facts` first. Then one `Agent` call with
`subagent_type: resume-kit:resume-writer`, carrying exactly these lines:

    draft: <absolute path to the draft YAML>
    role: <role, company, dates, as the draft's entry names them>
    facts: <the KNOWLEDGE.md section heading, or several, one per line>

Relay its report, build the draft to a temporary path, and run
`resume-kit:resume-review` on it. The summary is not the writer's: draft
two candidates in chat, in the author's register, for the user to pick or
rewrite. Promoting a draft over the live file is the user's call and never
this skill's.

## After editing the template

`components.typ`'s `geo` dictionary holds measurements calibrated against a
real rendered reference, so a change to one value moves the whole page;
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/design-spec.md` explains what each one is and why it
holds that number. After any edit to `template.typ` or `components.typ`,
run `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tools/check-fidelity.sh`. It renders the shipped
example and compares that render elementwise against the committed
baseline, failing on any line whose text, page, column or
position moved (§7 of `design-spec.md`). If the move was deliberate,
rerun it with `--update` and commit the new baseline with the change.
