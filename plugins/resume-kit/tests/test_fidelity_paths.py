"""The renderer scripts must find their inputs from their own location.

An earlier version of `check-fidelity.sh` anchored its inputs at a fixed
absolute path built from `$HOME`. That path is correct on exactly one
machine: a CI runner checks the repository out somewhere else entirely, with
`$HOME` set to something like `/root`, and the check failed with
"fixture ... missing" before it ever compiled anything. The first test pins
that fix.

The other two pin the `-P` in `cd -P "$(dirname "$0")/.."`, in
`tools/check-fidelity.sh` and in `bin/build`. Physical and logical
resolution disagree only when a symlink sits at or below the directory being
walked out of, so each of those tests builds a holder directory whose single
entry is a symlink to the real `tools/` or `bin/`. Logical `..` lands in the
holder, which has no template, fixture or font in it, and the script fails;
physical `..` lands in the skill directory and it works. Symlinking the
whole skill directory instead, which is what this file used to do,
distinguishes nothing: logical `..` climbs back through that link to the
same directory the physical walk reaches, so both scripts passed with `-P`
removed.

Only the path tests were carried over from the renderer's original suite.
The rest covered a golden-reference comparison script, deleted along with
the fixture it pointed at when the snapshot test replaced it.
